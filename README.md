Computational Boundary Sampling for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy is a sampling technique to accelerate the IMRT 
optimization. The detail explanation of the method can be found in the paper.pdf in the trunk directory. 

Here is the step by step method for running the code.
1) Download the CERR from http://www.cerr.info/about.php and make sure you update the startup.m file.
2) Get Mosek solver from http://www.mosek.com/
3) You can run the application by command matlab<run.m.
4) If you have any problem contact me at pbtiwari@wustl.edu
